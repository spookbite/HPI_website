# Housing Price Index

The [Housing Price Index (HPI)](http://www.housingpriceindex.in/) tracks residential home prices and quantities across the eight largest cities in India. The indices are constructed using quarterly survey data collected by [Housing.com](https://housing.com/) and are available from 2017-present. The survey includes information on price per square foot, quantity, and the total value of transactions for various sub-localities within each city collected from real-estate developers and brokers. The India level indices provide an average movement in prices and quantities across the eight cities. Finally, each index is normalized to a value of 100 in January 2017.

The website has been hosted with heroku and you can go [here](http://www.housingpriceindex.in/) for the live version of the project.
